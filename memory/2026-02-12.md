# 2026-02-12 — First Session

- First proper chat with Bryce after setup
- He asked "what are we tackling today?" — ready to help with whatever he needs
- MEMORY.md already has the essentials from our initial setup
- Current model: moonshot/kimi-k2.5

Nothing else to capture from this brief exchange.
