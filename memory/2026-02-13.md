# 2026-02-13 — SWARM OS Development

## Session Overview
Major progress on SWARM OS infrastructure. Built enhanced Mission Control dashboard and complete Discord integration package.

## Accomplishments

### Dashboard v1.0 (Deployed)
- Live at: https://training-dashboard-gamma.vercel.app/swarm-os.html
- 4-tab navigation: Overview | Agents | Operations | Logs
- Agent hierarchy visualization (Bryce CEO → Stu Orchestrator → 3 task agents)
- Real-time LLM usage tracking ($8.87 today)
- Protocol toggle switches (Morning Brief, Compliance, Workout, LLM Monitor)
- Fitness metrics (192 lbs current → 185 goal)
- Cut protocol active: 2,600 cal, 230g protein

### Discord Integration Package
Created complete setup in `/discord-setup/`:
- **BRYCE-2MIN-CHECKLIST.md** — Quick setup guide
- **swarm_setup_bot.py** — Automated server configuration
- **agent_bot.py** — Full bot implementations for all agents
- **Webhooks & configs** — Connection points for agents

### Discord Server
- Bryce created server: https://discord.gg/kR8MCCgx
- Ready for bot integration

### Sub-Agent Spawned
- Created Discord agent to work in parallel
- Agent building interactive bot code while I work on dashboard

## Current Stack
- **Peptides:** Reta (1mg) + CJC/IPA (6 units) for cut
- **Weight:** 192 lbs → 185 goal
- **LLM Spend:** ~$8-12/day target (Kimi K2.5)

## Next Steps
1. Complete enhanced dashboard v2 (cinematic aesthetic)
2. Finalize Discord bot deployment
3. Connect agents to both Telegram and Discord
4. Test @mention interactions

## Files Created/Modified
- `/root/.openclaw/workspace/swarm-os-v2.html` (dashboard source)
- `/root/.openclaw/workspace/discord-setup/` (full package)
- GitHub repo: `stubot19-eng/training-dashboard` (deploy key auth)

## Notes
- Vercel deployment stable (no more tunnel crashes)
- Discord requires bot applications for two-way chat
- Webhooks sufficient for one-way agent updates
