# 2026-02-13 — SWARM OS Development

## Session Overview
Major progress on SWARM OS infrastructure. Built enhanced Mission Control dashboard and complete Discord integration package.

## Accomplishments

### Dashboard v1.0 (Deployed)
- Live at: https://training-dashboard-gamma.vercel.app/swarm-os.html
- 4-tab navigation: Overview | Agents | Operations | Logs
- Agent hierarchy visualization (Bryce CEO → Stu Orchestrator → 3 task agents)
- Real-time LLM usage tracking ($8.87 today)
- Protocol toggle switches (Morning Brief, Compliance, Workout, LLM Monitor)
- Fitness metrics (192 lbs current → 185 goal)
- Cut protocol active: 2,600 cal, 230g protein

### Discord Integration Package
Created complete setup in `/discord-setup/`:
- **BRYCE-2MIN-CHECKLIST.md** — Quick setup guide
- **swarm_setup_bot.py** — Automated server configuration
- **agent_bot.py** — Full bot implementations for all agents
- **Webhooks & configs** — Connection points for agents

### Discord Server
- Bryce created server: https://discord.gg/kR8MCCgx
- Ready for bot integration

### Sub-Agent Spawned
- Created Discord agent to work in parallel
- Agent building interactive bot code while I work on dashboard

## Current Stack
- **Peptides:** Reta (1mg) + CJC/IPA (6 units) for cut
- **Weight:** 192 lbs → 185 goal
- **LLM Spend:** ~$8-12/day target (Kimi K2.5)

## Next Steps
1. Complete enhanced dashboard v2 (cinematic aesthetic)
2. Finalize Discord bot deployment
3. Connect agents to both Telegram and Discord
4. Test @mention interactions

## Files Created/Modified
- `/root/.openclaw/workspace/swarm-os-v2.html` (dashboard source)
- `/root/.openclaw/workspace/discord-setup/` (full package)
- GitHub repo: `stubot19-eng/training-dashboard` (deploy key auth)

## Evening Session — Dashboard v2.0 & Discord Bots

### Dashboard v2.0 Complete
- **File:** `swarm-os-v2.html` — cinematic sci-fi Mission Control theme
- **Features:** Orbitron typography, scanlines, glow effects, animated backgrounds
- **Agent modals:** Full details with Telegram handles, Discord channels, responsibilities
- **Discord integration:** Webhook test buttons for all 5 channels
- **Mobile responsive:** Works on all screen sizes
- **Keyboard shortcuts:** 1-4 for tabs, ESC to close modals

### Discord Bots Status
- **Stu:** ✅ Running and responding to @mentions in #general
- **FitBot, SourceBot, AuditBot:** ❌ Need Python files created (terminal issues)
- **Tokens:** Posted publicly multiple times — need reset after deployment

### Current Blockers
1. **GitHub push blocked** — GitHub secret scanning detected Discord tokens in commit history
2. **Options:** Approve secrets via GitHub UI or create fresh branch without token history
3. **Deploy key:** Added to repo, works for auth

### User Feedback
- Bryce expressed frustration with delays and errors
- Wants faster, more autonomous execution
- Gave permission to use Sonnet if needed, $5 budget limit
- Reset expectations: deliver working product, not perfect process

## Lessons
- File creation via terminal (heredocs) is fragile — use Python scripts or text editors
- Git history with secrets is hard to clean — use .gitignore from start
- Discord bot hosting needs simpler solution (Replit, VPS, or local with better instructions)
- Over-promising leads to under-delivering — better to scope smaller and nail it

## Evening Session Update — 18:40 UTC

### Dashboard v2.0 — DEPLOYED ✅
- **Live:** https://training-dashboard-gamma.vercel.app/swarm-os-v2.html
- **Features:** Cinematic sci-fi theme, real-time data hooks, agent modals with Telegram/Discord contacts
- **Status:** Working, showing live data when API connected

### Discord Bots — 90% Complete
- **All 4 bots running** on VPS (Stu, FitBot, SourceBot, AuditBot)
- **Connected to Discord Gateway** ✅
- **Issue:** Permission/responding problem — Bryce re-invited with permissions
- **Pending:** Test if @mentions work now

### Current Blocker
- Bots online but may need permission verification in Discord
- Testing in progress

### Security Note
- Discord tokens exposed in chat multiple times
- **MUST reset** after bots confirmed working

### Next Steps
1. Confirm bots respond to @mentions
2. Reset all 4 Discord tokens
3. API server hosting (optional — dashboard works without)
